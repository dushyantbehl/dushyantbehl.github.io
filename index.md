I'm Dushyant. I work as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research on performance and security of systems and networks.
My current work focuses on improving performance and reliability in Telco Network Functions on Kubernetes.

Earlier I was part of the Blockchain and Smart Contracts group where I worked on interoperatbility of permissioned blockchains and decentralized marketplace protocols to ensure fair exchange of digital assets using blockchain.

My alternate interest lies in system security and I have written a custom hypervisor from scratch on both ARM and x86 for providing security in, multitenant cloud and enterprise BYOD scenarios. I have also worked with Trusted Execution Environments like Intel SGX.

I obtained a Dual Degree (M.Tech and B.Tech) in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D) where I worked in the areas of Cloud Computing, Virtualization, Operating Systems and Network Security.
