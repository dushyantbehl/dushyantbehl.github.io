Hola Stranger

I'm Dushyant. I work as a Research Software Engineer at IBM Research. My interests lie in performance and security of systems and networks. I currently work to improve performance and fault management in Telco network functions.
Prior to this I was part of the Blockchain and Smart Contracts group where I worked extensively on interoperatbility of permissioned blockchains and protocol for decentralized marketplace ensuring fair exchange of digital assets using blockchain.
My alternate interest lies in system security and I have written a custom hypervisor from scratch on both ARM and x86 for providing security in, general cloud and enterprise BYOD scenarios. I have also worked with Trusted Execution Environments like Intel SGX.

I obtained a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India (IIT-D) where I worked in the areas of Cloud Computing, Virtualization, Operating Systems and Network Security.
